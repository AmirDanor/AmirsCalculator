# Amir's Advanced Calculator
*This project is my final exercise in Python, focused on building an advanced calculator with extra functionality.
The goal is to implement a calculator from scratch that supports not only basic arithmetic, but also advanced operations.*

## Key Features:
 - **Supports Basic Operations:** Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
 - **Includes Advanced Operations:** Exponentiation (^), Modulo (%), Maximum ($), Minimum (&), Average (@), Negation (~), Factorial (!), and Summation (#).
 - **Compatible with Parentheses.**
 - **Interactive Loop:** Allows users to input and evaluate expressions continuously until they choose to exit by typing 'quit'.
 - **Error Handling:** Invalid terms and operations trigger informative error messages.

## Design Principles:
 - **SOLID Principles**
 - **Object-Oriented Design**
 - **Interpreter-Like Behavior**

## Notes
-  **0^0 = 1**
-  **Numbers starting with a decimal point are implicitly preceded by a zero (e.g., .12 = 0.12)**
-  **Numbers ending with a decimal point are implicitly followed by a zero. (e.g., 31. = 31.0)**
-  **Keyboard Interrupts are meant to stop the program's execution**

## Run From CMD:
 -  **Navigate to ...\Saved_Location\AmirsCalculator\ in cmd.**
 -  **Type: python -m calculator.main**
 -  **Hit Enter**
 - ***Done!***
