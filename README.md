# Amir's Advanced Calculator
*This project is my final exercise in Python, focused on building an advanced calculator with extra functionality.
The goal is to implement a calculator from scratch that supports not only basic arithmetic, but also advanced operations.*

## Key Features:
 - **Supports Basic Operations:** Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).
 - **Includes Advanced Operations:** Exponentiation (^), Modulo (%), Maximum ($), Minimum (&), Average (@), Negation (~), Factorial (!), and Summation (#).
 - **Compatible with Parentheses.**
 - **Interactive Loop:** Allows users to input and evaluate expressions continuously until they choose to exit by typing 'quit'.
 - **Error Handling:** Invalid terms and operations trigger informative error messages.

## Design Principles:
 - **SOLID Principles**
 - **Object-Oriented Design**
 - **Interpreter-Like Behavior**
